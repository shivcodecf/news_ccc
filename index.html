        <p class="text">The latest study to examine how tiny amounts of psychedelics can impact mental health provides
            further evidence of the therapeutic potential of microdosing.


            Published in Scientific Reports this week, the study followed 953 people taking regular small amounts of
            psilocybin and a second group of 180people who were not microdosing. This research, led by University of
            British Columbia Okanagan's Dr. Zach Walsh and doctoral student Joseph Rootman, is the latest study to come
            from the Microdose.me project.
            <span class="moreText">For the 30-day study, participants were asked to complete a number of assessments
                that tapped into mental health symptomology, mood and measures of cognition. For example, a smartphone
                finger tap test was integrated into the study to measure psychomotor ability, which can be used as a
                marker for neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease.<span class="dots">....</span>

                Those microdosing demonstrated greater improvements in mood, mental health and psychomotor ability over
                the one-month period, compared to non-microdosing peers who completed the same assessments.

                "This is the largest longitudinal study of this kind to date of microdosing psilocybin, and one of the
                few studies to engage a control group," says Dr. Walsh, who teaches in the Irving K. Barber Faculty of
                Arts and Social Sciences. "Our findings of improved mood and reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety and
                stress add to the growing conversation about the therapeutic potential of microdosing."

                Large doses of psychedelic psilocybin mushrooms have a long history of use among some Indigenous peoples
                and are prized inWestern culture for their psychedelic effects, explains Dr. Walsh. They were also
                labeled an illicit substance during the American-led "war on drugs." But recent interest has expanded
                from large dose psychedelic use—known for creating dramatic alterations in mood and consciousness—to the
                potential therapeutic application of smaller microdoses; amounts so small they minimally interfere with
                daily functioning.

                The Microdose.me project is conducted by an international team including Dr. Pam Kryskow from UBC
                Vancouver, Maggie Kiraga and Dr. Kim Kuypers from Maastricht University in the Netherlands, American
                mycologist Paul Stamets, and Kalin Harvey and Eesmyal Santos-Brault of the Quantified Citizen health

            <p class="th"> Brain tumour is a serious disease that occurs due to the growth of abnormal cells in one’s
                brain. Tumours can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Tumour growth can be
                life-threatening irrespective of its malignant or benign qualities because it increases the pressure
                inside our skull thus leading to brain damage. The location and the growth of the tumour determine how
                it will affect the nervous system of the body. The chance of brain tumours in India ranges from 5 to 10
                per 100,000 population which is slowly increasing.</p>

        <img src="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/images/basics/Symptoms-twitter.jpg?_=84668">
        <p>Symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the location, size, type and growth of the tumour. Some symptoms are
            generic because tumours create pressure on the brain while others can be specific as they affect a specific
            part of the brain. Here are some general symptoms you can look out for:</p>
        <p class="ifua">General Symptoms:</p>
        <div class="liuf">
            <ul>
                <li>@Change in pattern of Headaches</li>
                <li>@Unexplained nausea</li>
                <li>@Seizures (most common in adults)</li>
                <li>@Slurred speech</li>
                <li>@Impaired Vision, including blurred vision or double vision</li>
                <li>@Sudden muscle jerk or spasm</li>
                <li>@Difficulty in balancing</li>
                <li>@Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs</li>
                <li>@Muscle weakness in the face, arm or leg</li>

                <!-- <li>#Change in performing daily tasks</li> -->

            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>These symptoms can result from many diseases besides a brain tumour. In case of sudden changes, please visit a
        doctor and get a check-up done professionally, do not assume one has a brain tumour just because some symptoms
        match.</p>

        <p>A brain tumour is a complex disease and due to its complexity, there are many myths about a brain tumour, its
            risk factors and its treatment. Let’s debunk some myths about brain tumour:</p>
        <p><span class="idks">Myth:</span> All brain tumours are deadly</p>
        <p><span class="idks">Truth:</span> Not all brain tumours are cancerous, most non-cancerous brain tumours can be
            treated completely.</p>
        <p><span class="idks">Myth:</span> All brain tumours originate from the brain</p>
        <p><span class="idks">Truth:</span> Some brain tumours originate from the brain, while others are caused due to
            spread of cancer throughout the body.</p>
        <p><span class="idks">Myth:</span> Using Mobile phones causes a brain tumour</p>
        <p><span class="idks">Truth:</span> There is no evidence to support that mobile phones can cause brain tumours
        </p>
        <p><span class="idks">Myth:</span> All brain tumour patients have the same symptoms</p>

        <div class="pvlhb1"><p> Treatment</p>
        </div>
        <p> The treatment of brain tumours depends on the size, growth, location, potential compilations and the health
            of the patient. Clinically dangerous benign tumours can be removed with surgery, while metastatic tumours
            can be treated under the same guideline as primary cancer. The following treatments can be standalone, but
            in most cases, a combination of these treatments are given to a patient. Treatments of brain tumours
            include:



       <p><span class="text5"> Surgery:</span> This is the usual treatment for brain tumours. To remove the tumour, the neurosurgeon performs a
            craniotomy, where they open the skull and remove the tumour. While the doctor strives to remove the tumour c
            completely, in some cases the tumour cannot be removed completely without damaging the healthy parts of the
            brain. Partial removal of the brain tumour can also be beneficial for the patient.</p>

        <p> <span class="text5">Chemotherapy:</span> It is the use of drugs to kill the tumour cells, they restrict the growth of the tumour by not
            allowing them to divide and make more cells. It can be taken orally or through an intravenous line.
            Chemotherapy can be given after the surgery to kill the rest of the cells and reduce the symptoms.</p>

        <p><span class="text5">Radiation Therapy:</span> It is the use of high radiations such as X-rays or protons, to kill the tumour cell. Doctors
        use radiation therapy to slow down or stop the growth of the tumour. There are two types of radiation therapies:</p>

        External Beam Radiation: The radiation comes from a machine that is outside the body, it releases high beam
        radiation focusing only on the location of the tumour, or it can be applied to the whole brain.</p>
